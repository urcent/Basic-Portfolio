                    <h3>Why am i here?</h3>
                    <p>
                        What made me intrested in doing the codeing boot camp was that i love computers and i had a bit of experince in programing android games. But what push me the most of finishing this class is to finally get a job to where i use my mind more than my muscle, being able to propely take care of my wife, have a family and being able to make much more money to take care of me and my family.
