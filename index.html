<p>Hello my name is Darryl Scott but also like to be known as Scott.
I am a introvert type person that really want to become a extrovert to work well with other and have a more fun life. 
<br>
I was born and raise in Savannah, Georgia in March 19, 1990. I love dogs because all through out my life since i was born i never went 2 full years with out haveing a pet dog. (Although i always wanted a turtle when i was little.) My child hood hero was Sonic the hegehog, and my favorite type of candy is sour candy. My wife is my highschool sweet-heart and befor recently getting married we have been together for 8 years.
<br>
What made me intrested in doing the codeing boot camp was that i love computers and i had a bit of experince in programing android games. But what push me the most of finishing this class is to finally get a job to where i use my mind more than my muscle, being able to propely take care of my wife, and being able to make much more money.
